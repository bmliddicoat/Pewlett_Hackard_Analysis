# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Pewlett Hackard has asked for data analysis to help determine a plan with retirement trends within the company.  The original areas that were first addressed was overcovering which employees could receive a retirement package and secondly which positions will need to be field. After the initial analyzation, the manager has asked for determination the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  These areas of concern are due to "silver tsunami"(many current employees reach retirement age).  The project will be accomplished by SQL.  PostgreSQL and pgAdmin will be used to perform the SQL analyzation.

    *  72,458 Total Number of Employees Retiring
    *  Senior positions of Staff and Engineering total 50,842.  70% of retiring in higher senior roles.   
### The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
    * The total number of eligible mentors is 1,941
    * This is further broken down by assistant engineer (41), staff (271), senior staff(633), technique leader(99), engineer(286) and senior engineer(610).   

## Summary: 

### Roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami".
A total of 72,458 roles will need to be filled when "silver tsunami" begins.  The high concern for this mass retirement is number of senior roles that may hold leadership responsibilities.  In looking at the numbers, 70% of retirement may come from senior roles in staff and engineering.  This dramatic loss of leadership could impact the business without a sudden shift to create mentorship program for internal employees and hiring from outside the company to fill these positions.  

### Qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor.  

There is not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees.  The total number is 1,941.  Pewlett Hackard lacks mentor count to train/mentor the next generation.

The data on salaries for retirees and potential mentor can be vital information for the company.  The wages could be compared against competitors, internal employees, and local wages.  The hiring department can determine how to use these salaries to incentives external applicants and internal applicants.  Also, if wages are lower than competitors, the company could see a tsunami of workers leaving for higher compensation.  The silver 'tsunami' and incentive "tsunami" could be disastrous for Pewleer Hackard.
